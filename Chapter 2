For Pythagorean Theorem formula:

This programs the answer to enter automatically once you set the variables

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))

c = (a**2 + b**2) ** 0.5

print(c)


For converting currencies into total USD

pesos = int(input('What do you have left in pesos? '))
soles = int(input('What do you have left in soles? '))
reais = int(input('What do you have left in reais? '))

total = pesos * 0.00025 + soles * 0.28 + reais * 0.21

print(total)

To roll a dice:
import random

def roll_dice(sides=6):
  """Simulates rolling a die with a specified number of sides.

  Args:
    sides: The number of sides on the die (default is 6).

  Returns:
    A random integer between 1 and 'sides' (inclusive).
  """
  return random.randint(1, sides)

# Example usage:
# Roll a standard six-sided die
result_six_sided = roll_dice()
print(f"You rolled a {result_six_sided} on a 6-sided die.")

# Roll a 20-sided die
result_twenty_sided = roll_dice(sides=20)
print(f"You rolled a {result_twenty_sided} on a 20-sided die.")
